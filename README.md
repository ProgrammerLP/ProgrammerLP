<h2>News</h2>
<h3>ANNOUNCEMENT</h3>
Some of you may have noticed that the server has a new name. This means that the server is no longer called ProgrammerLP, but Adeptstack, the new name under which the applications will be published.

A resulting step is also the renaming of various applications, e.g.
PLP-NoTas will now be called Notivity.
Other apps will also be renamed.

The changes will be implemented gradually with new updates in the near future.
This change will not affect you, except that you will have to get used to the new name.

<h2>News</h2>
<h3>2022/08/01</h3>
<p>I have a big change coming up.
I want to make certain apps LTS apps.

That means:
-Apps with LTS will no longer get feature updates! [...] However, they will still get minor updates for bug fixes and new standards for apps that I set, e.g. when all apps become Responsive.
Apps with LTS will get bug fix updates for at least 5 years.

-Apps without LTS will still get bug fix and feature updates. Everything stays the same for the apps.

In the future you will find a note in the apps that have LTS, the supported apps will also get a note on their website!


The following already published apps will get LTS:
- PLP PC-Info (LTS)
- PLP Fuelinfo (LTS)

Feel free to write your opinion about it in feedback !
Thanks a lot </p>
